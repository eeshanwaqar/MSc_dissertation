## TL;DR

This repository contains the public version of my MSc dissertation, in which I designed and evaluated an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict the success of consulting projects using structured organizational data.

The work focuses on real-world challenges such as feature engineering, model selection, evaluation strategy, and business-aligned performance metrics, while operating under strict NDA and data governance constraints.

> **Note:** Due to confidentiality, the original dataset and implementation code cannot be shared. This repository contains the full academic dissertation and a public technical summary.

## Problem Statement

Consulting firms often struggle to identify early risk signals in ongoing projects, leading to cost overruns, delayed delivery, and reduced client satisfaction.

The goal of this dissertation was to:

> Build a predictive system capable of estimating project success likelihood using historical project characteristics and organisational indicators.

---

## Key Objectives

- Explore and understand real-world organisational project data.
- Engineer meaningful features representing project structure, scope, and context.
- Compare multiple machine learning models for predictive performance.
- Evaluate models using business-relevant metrics.
- Interpret results to support decision-making in consulting environments.

## Methodology (High-Level)

The project followed a standard ML lifecycle:

1. **Data Understanding & EDA**  
   Analysis of missing values, distributions, correlations, and anomalies.

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   Creation of derived features based on project attributes.  
   Encoding and normalisation of structured data.

3. **Model Development**  
   Baseline models for comparison.  
   Advanced models for improved predictive power.

4. **Evaluation**  
   Cross-validation.  
   Precision, recall, and business-aligned metrics.

5. **Interpretation & Insights**  
   Identification of key drivers of project success.  
   Discussion of model limitations and trade-offs.

## Results (Abstracted)

While exact figures cannot be disclosed, the final models:

- Significantly outperformed baseline predictors.
- Demonstrated strong ability to identify high-risk projects early.
- Provided interpretable insights into the most influential project factors.

---

## Real-World Constraints

This work was conducted under:

- Strict NDA agreements  
- Sensitive organisational data policies  
- Ethical and governance requirements  

As a result:

- No raw data or production code is included.
- All findings are presented in an anonymised, academic format.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Machine Learning (classification, evaluation)
- Feature engineering on structured data
- Data analysis & visualisation
- Business-driven metric design
- Technical writing and research communication
- Working under real-world data constraints

## Transferability to Industry

This project mirrors how ML systems are built in production:

- Messy, imperfect data  
- Business-driven objectives  
- Interpretability over pure accuracy  
- Constraints on data access and sharing  

The same design principles apply to:

- Risk modelling  
- Forecasting systems  
- Decision-support tools  
- Enterprise analytics pipelines
